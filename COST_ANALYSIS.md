## Processing Volume Cost Projections

### Low Volume (1-100 images/month)
```
Replicate Enhancement: 100 × $0.025 = $2.50
OpenRouter Classification: 100 × $0.0045 = $0.45
Total Monthly Cost: ~$3.00
Cost per image: ~$0.03
```

### Medium Volume (100-1,000 images/month)
```
Replicate Enhancement: 1,000 × $0.025 = $25.00
OpenRouter Classification: 1,000 × $0.0045 = $4.50
Total Monthly Cost: ~$30.00
Cost per image: ~$0.03
```

### High Volume (1,000-10,000 images/month)
```
Replicate Enhancement: 10,000 × $0.025 = $250.00
OpenRouter Classification: 10,000 × $0.0045 = $45.00
Total Monthly Cost: ~$295.00
Cost per image: ~$0.03
```

### Enterprise Volume (10,000+ images/month)
```
Replicate Enhancement: 50,000 × $0.025 = $1,250.00
OpenRouter Classification: 50,000 × $0.0045 = $225.00
Total Monthly Cost: ~$1,475.00
Cost per image: ~$0.03
```

## Fallback Processing Costs

### Client-Side Processing (Free Tier)
- **Cost**: $0.00 per image
- **Processing time**: 2-5 seconds per image
- **Quality**: 70-80% of API quality
- **Limitations**: Browser-dependent, limited algorithms

### Self-Hosted Models
- **Initial setup cost**: $500-2,000 (GPU hardware)
- **Monthly hosting**: $50-200 (cloud GPU instances)
- **Processing cost**: ~$0.001 per image (electricity/compute)
- **Quality**: 85-95% of API quality
- **Break-even point**: ~1,000-5,000 images/month

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Intelligent Fallback System
```
- Use client-side processing for simple enhancements
- Reserve API calls for complex/high-quality requirements
- Potential savings: 30-50% on total processing costs
```

### 2. Batch Processing Optimization
```
- Group similar images for batch API calls
- Use cheaper models for bulk processing
- Implement smart queuing to reduce API timeouts
- Potential savings: 10-20% on API costs
```

### 3. Caching and Deduplication
```
- Cache enhanced images to avoid reprocessing
- Implement image similarity detection
- Store common enhancement patterns
- Potential savings: 15-25% on repeat processing
```

### 4. Model Selection Optimization
```
- Use GFPGAN for portraits ($0.021 avg)
- Use Real-ESRGAN for general images ($0.027 avg)
- Use CodeFormer only for severely damaged images ($0.069 avg)
- Potential savings: 20-30% through smart model selection
```

## Credit Purchase Recommendations
