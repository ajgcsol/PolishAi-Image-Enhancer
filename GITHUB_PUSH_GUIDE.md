## 🔐 Authentication Required

The push failed because GitHub requires authentication. Here are your options:

### Option 1: Push from Your Local Machine (Recommended)

1. **Download your private backup files first:**
   - Download `private-backup-files.zip` from this cloud instance
   - Extract and save `.env.local` securely

2. **Clone and push from your local machine:**
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository (create it on GitHub first if needed)
   git clone https://github.com/ajgcsol/advanced-image-enhancement.git
   cd advanced-image-enhancement
   
   # Copy all files from this cloud instance to your local clone
   # (You can download the entire project as ZIP or copy files manually)
   
   # Add your environment file
   cp /path/to/backup/.env.local .env.local
   
   # Verify Git configuration
   git config user.name "ajgcsol"
   git config user.email "agregware@charlestonlaw.edu"
   
   # Add, commit, and push
   git add .
