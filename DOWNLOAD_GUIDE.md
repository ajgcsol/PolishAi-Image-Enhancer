# 📥 Download Guide for Private Files

## 🎯 What You Need to Download

Since you're working in a cloud instance, you need to download your **private files** that contain sensitive information (API keys) before publishing to GitHub.

## 📦 Available Download Packages

I've created two compressed archives containing all your private files:

### Option 1: TAR.GZ Archive (Recommended for Linux/Mac)
- **File**: `private-backup-files.tar.gz`
- **Size**: 5.0K
- **Format**: Compressed tar archive

### Option 2: ZIP Archive (Recommended for Windows)
- **File**: `private-backup-files.zip`
- **Size**: 6.5K
- **Format**: Standard ZIP archive

## 📁 What's Inside the Archives

Both archives contain the `backup-for-download/` folder with:

### 🔑 Critical Files
- **`.env.local`** - Your actual API keys (NEVER share this!)
  - Replicate API Key: `your_replicate_api_key_here`
  - OpenRouter API Key: `your_openrouter_api_key_here`

### 📚 Documentation Files
- **`BACKUP_README.md`** - Security warnings and key information
- **`local-setup-guide.md`** - Complete setup instructions for your local machine
- **`development-notes.md`** - Technical notes and configuration details

## 🚀 How to Download

### In VSCode Web Interface:
1. **Right-click** on `private-backup-files.zip` in the file explorer
2. Select **"Download"**
3. Save to a secure location on your computer

### Using Command Line (if available):
```bash
# Download via SCP (if you have SSH access)
scp user@cloud-instance:/path/to/private-backup-files.zip ~/Downloads/

# Or use wget/curl if the files are served via HTTP
wget http://your-cloud-instance/private-backup-files.zip
```

## 🔧 After Downloading

### 1. Extract the Archive
```bash
# For ZIP file
unzip private-backup-files.zip

# For TAR.GZ file
tar -xzf private-backup-files.tar.gz
```

### 2. Secure Storage
- **Move** the `.env.local` file to a secure location
- **Store** in password manager or encrypted folder
- **Never** share these files with anyone
- **Never** commit them to any Git repository

### 3. Local Setup
When you clone your GitHub repository locally:
```bash
# Clone your published repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-image-enhancement.git
cd advanced-image-enhancement

# Copy your private environment file
cp /path/to/backup/.env.local .env.local

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development
npm run dev
```

## 🛡️ Security Reminders

### ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY WARNINGS
- **NEVER** upload these files to GitHub
- **NEVER** share the `.env.local` file
- **NEVER** post API keys in issues, forums, or chat
- **ALWAYS** use different keys for production

### ✅ Safe Practices
- Store API keys in password manager
- Use environment variables in production
- Rotate keys every 90 days
- Monitor API usage regularly

## 🔄 What Happens Next

### 1. Your Cloud Repository is Safe
- All sensitive files are properly ignored by Git
- Only public-safe files will be committed
- Your API keys are protected

### 2. Publishing to GitHub
After downloading your private files, you can safely:
```bash
# Add all public files
git add .

# Commit safely (no sensitive data)
git commit -m "feat: Advanced AI Image Enhancement Application"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### 3. Local Development
Use the downloaded `.env.local` file for local development while keeping your GitHub repository clean and secure.
